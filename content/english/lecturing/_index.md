# TEACHING WORK

**OFFICE R2.07:** 2nd floor, down the hallway on the right  
**OFFICE HOURS:**  
By prior appointment or via email

From 1982 to 1984, I was employed at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering (FE) as a research trainee. From 1984 to 1995, I worked as a teaching assistant at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and later at the Faculty of Computer and Information Science (FRI). I delivered several seminars on machine learning systems, logic programming, and neural networks. As a teaching assistant, I led exercises for 5 courses under the old program at the then-FER, 9 courses under the new higher education program at FRI, and 1 course in the vocational program at FRI.

From 1996, I was employed as an associate professor at FRI, and since 2002, as a full professor. I lectured in two courses in the vocational program and three courses in the higher professional program (**before the Bologna reform**):

- **Programming Languages** (VSŠ)
- **Fundamentals of Algorithms and Data Structures II** (VSŠ)
- **Artificial Intelligence Methods** (VSŠ)

and three courses in the university program (**before the Bologna reform**):

- **Algorithms and Data Structures I** (UNI, IŠRM)
- **Knowledge Technology** (UNI)
- **Theory of Machine Learning** (IŠRM)

and two courses in the postgraduate program (**before the Bologna reform**):

- **Machine Learning** (Master's level)
- **Knowledge Discovery in Databases** (Master's level)

**Courses I have taught** (after the Bologna reform):

### AT THE UNDERGRADUATE LEVEL:

- [**Artificial Intelligence** (VSŠ)]({{< relref "umetna_inteligenca" >}})
- [**Algorithms and Data Structures I** (UNI)]({{< relref "aps1" >}})

### AT THE MASTER'S LEVEL:

- [**Machine Learning**]({{< relref "strojno_ucenje" >}})

I am the (co)author (see bibliography) of 2 high school textbooks, 8 university textbooks (3 of which have been published in a second, revised edition), and 2 books published abroad (in England). I have supervised 2 final theses, 84 undergraduate theses, 15 master's theses, and 15 doctoral dissertations.

I have participated in numerous defenses of bachelor's, master's, and doctoral theses at the Faculty of Computer and Information Science, the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, and other faculties at the University of Ljubljana (Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, Faculty of Arts, Faculty of Chemistry and Chemical Technology), the University of Maribor, the University of Rijeka in Croatia, the University of Porto in Portugal, the University of Sarajevo in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Anna University in Chennai, India.

In the summer of 1993, I spent two months on professional development at Caltech University in Pasadena, USA. I have also undertaken several shorter working visits (1–3 weeks) to various universities abroad (USA, Canada, Australia, Europe).

In addition to non-academic institutions, I have delivered invited lectures at the following universities:

- 1989 at the University of Zagreb;
- 1993 at Caltech University (3 times) (Pasadena, California);
- 1995 at IBM Watson Research Center, New York;
- 2000 at the University of Porto;
- 2004 at the University of Maribor;
- 2014 at the University of Split;
- 2017 at Royal Holloway, University of London.
