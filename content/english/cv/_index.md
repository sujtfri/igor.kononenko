# IGOR KONONENKO CIRICULUM VITAE

&nbsp;

**Igor Kononenko** received his B.Sc. in 1982, M.Sc. in 1985, and Ph.D. in 1990 in computer science from University of Ljubljana, Slovenia. He is a professor at the Faculty of Computer and Information Science in Ljubljana (courses: Algorithms and Data Structures I, Machine Learning, Intelligent Systems, Artificial Intelligence) and the head of the Laboratory for Cognitive Modeling.

&nbsp;

Altogether, he is the (co)author of about 225 papers (90 papers in peer-reviewed journals, 15 book chapters, 120 papers in conference proceedings) and 12 books. His papers have been cited over 3000 times by other authors (self-citations excluded).

&nbsp;

The research led by him includes:

- the development of machine learning algorithms,
- the development of tools for attribute evaluation and ranking,
- feature subset selection,
- image parametrization and classification,
- evaluation of prediction reliability in classification and regression,
- logic programming and expert systems development,
- neural networks and genetic algorithms,
- inductive logic programming,
- explaining decisions of various prediction models,
- text mining and spatial data mining,
- web-users profiling,
- understanding the impact of learning on intelligence and its relation to consciousness.

&nbsp;

The application areas of the developed methodologies include:

- medical diagnosis and prognosis,
- quality control,
- image analysis,
- modeling of biological and physical processes,
- measurement and analysis of subtle fields,
- evaluation of the effectiveness of the allopathic and complementary medicine, etc.

&nbsp;

Igor Kononenko was actively involved in research in 24 national and international research projects, 12 of them as the head of the project. In recent years he headed the following research projects:

- Artificial Intelligence and Intelligent Systems (2004-2008)
- [Machine Learning of Probabilities with Applications to Web Portals and Medical Diagnostics](http://www.fri.uni-lj.si/en/laboratories/lkm/5726/project.html) (2006-2008)

- Artificial Intelligence and Intelligent Systems (2015–2020)

&nbsp;

He is a member of the editorial board of _Applied Intelligence Journal_ and _Informatica Journal_. He was three times a chair and proceedings editor of international scientific conferences. He was a member of the program committee of 40 international scientific conferences, mostly European Conference of Machine Learning (ECML), International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), and Artificial Intelligence Conferences. He reviewed over 350 papers for peer-reviewed journals and international conferences.

&nbsp;

He supervised 90 BSc theses, 15 MSc theses, and 15 PhD theses. He had invited talks at three international scientific conferences and the following institutions: IBM Watson Research, New York; University of Zagreb, Croatia; Caltech University, Pasadena, California; University of Porto; University of Maribor, Slovenia; FESB, University of Split, Croatia.

&nbsp;

Awards: In 1988 he was awarded together with Dr. Bojan Cestnik and Prof. Ivan Bratko the National award Boris Kidrič for innovations for the System for inductive automatic learning Assistant 86. In 1992 he was awarded at the conference: Artificial Intelligence: Methodology, Systems and Applications AIMSA-92 with best-paper award. In 1992 he was awarded with Vidmar award for successful educational work. In 1993 he was awarded with Jožef Stefan Golden Medal for internationally recognized doctoral thesis. In 1997 he was awarded together with coauthors Dr. Matjaž Kukar, Dr. Ciril Grošelj and Dr. Jure Fettich with best-paper award at the conference: 10th IEEE Symposium on Computer Based Medical Systems CBMS-97. In 1999 he was elected to become the regular member of SATENA - Slovenian Academic Society for Science and Engineering. In 2006, the research group "Artificial Intelligence and Intelligent Systems", inside which he leads the subgroup - Laboratory for Cognitive modelling, was awarded by Slovenian Agency for Research of the republic of Slovenia as the best research program in 2005. In 2006 and in 2009 he received the "Certificate in recognition of continued commitment and service to the INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED INTELLIGENCE as an Editorial Board Member." In 2006 he became the Honorary member of the Editorial Advisory Board of the Journal of Engineering.In 2010 he received a reward for the popularization of the study of computer and information science. In 2016 Erik Štrumbelj was awarded by Jožef Stefan Golden Medal for his PhD, which he finished under supervision of Prof. Igor Kononenko.
